The following is a repository of direct links to Computer Science, Statistics, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Artificial Intelligence Books, and the like books, as I come around them. These will be mostly from the Open Publishing/ Freely made available content domain. If you find a book that does not belong here or should be removed, please raise the issue.
